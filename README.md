I have created a simson character classifier using deep computer vision. 
Here I have trained this model with about 42K simpson character images and this model has got 70% accuracy.

Libraries I have used:
1. TensorFlow
2. Keras
3. OpenCV
4. OS
5. Caer
6. Canaro
7. Matplotlib
8. ScikitLearn
9. Numpy
